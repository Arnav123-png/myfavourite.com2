                My hobby is to read intresting book in my free time. Whenever I go to school I take a book to read in my free time. I got my first book on my 5th birthday. First I thought that reading books is very boring, but when I started reading them I got the intrest in reading. Reading books is a good thing because we get to know about the new words and more informatoin. Reading books can make you a succsesful person in your life.
